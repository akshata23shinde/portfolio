                <p>Hello there! I'm a web Developer and Java Developer.</p>
                <p>I am Akshata Shinde, a final year Computer Engineering student from Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University, Lonere, with a strong academic record and practical experience in software development. With a CGPA of 8.21, I have honed my skills in various programming languages including C, C++, Java, Python, and web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.</p>

                <p>I have successfully completed projects such as an E-Commerce site for online electronic shop management and a web-based music application. My hands-on experience is further enriched by internships in web development and data science at Operand Technologies and YBI Foundation, respectively.</p>

                 <p>Beyond academics, I actively participate in extra-curricular activities like the National Service Scheme (NSS) and college cultural events. My soft skills include public speaking and creativity, and I enjoy hobbies such as traveling, listening to music, dancing, and making rangoli. I am eager to apply my skills and contribute to the growth of an innovative organization.</p>
